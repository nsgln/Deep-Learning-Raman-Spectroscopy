abstract = {LES SCHLAGWORT* / SMART FACTORY SYSTEMS Smart Factory Systems Jay Lee The manufacturing industry has been facing several challenges, including sustainability and performance of production. These challenges are sourced from numerous factors such as an aging workforce, changes in the landscape of global manufacturing and slow adaption of smart manufacturing by implementing IT in manufacturing process. In recent years, German and US governments have established separate initiatives to accelerate the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart ana-lytics technologies in the manufacturing industries and, consequently, to improve the overall perform-ance, quality, and controllability of manufacturing process. The smart factory is the integration of all recent IoT technological advances in computer networks, data integration, and analytics to bring transparency to all manufacturing factories. In this article, we review the most recent logistic decisions for taking smart factories from idea to reality and then describe the possible technologies for smart factories.},
